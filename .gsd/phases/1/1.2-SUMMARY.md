# Plan 1.2 Summary: Register & Login Logic (Parameterized)

## Objective
Implement the backend authentication endpoints using parameterized SQL queries to ensure zero vulnerability to SQL injection.

## Changes
- Added `UserRegister` and `UserLogin` Pydantic models to `main.py`.
- Implemented `POST /api/register` and `POST /api/login` endpoints.
- Used parameterized queries (`?`) for all database interactions.
- Added `email-validator` dependency for robust input validation.
- Created `scripts/test_auth.py` for empirical verification.

## Files Touched
- `backend/main.py`
- `scripts/test_auth.py`

## Verification
- Registered `test@example.com` successfully (Status 200).
- Logged in with valid credentials (Status 200).
- Verified email SQLi payload `admin@example.com' OR '1'='1` is blocked by Pydantic (Status 422).
- Verified password SQLi payload `' OR '1'='1` is neutralized by parameterized query (Status 401).

## Risks/Debt
- Password hashing is still pending (storing as plain text). This is a security debt that should be prioritized if this moves beyond a "fake server" prototype.
