# Summary — Plan 7.2: Implement Logging in Health Routes

## What Was Done
Integrated the prediction logging mechanism into all existing health assessment services.

### Changes Made
- **`backend/routes/heart.py`**: Added a call to `log_prediction` within the risk assessment logic. Captures demographic and clinical metrics in the `inputs` field.
- **`backend/routes/diabetes.py`**: Integrated `log_prediction` to record glucose, BMI, and other diabetes-related parameters.
- **`backend/routes/parkinsons.py`**: Integrated `log_prediction` to record key voice frequency and jitter metrics.

## Verification
- Verified that each route now imports `log_prediction` and `get_email` correctly.
- Verified that assessments are only logged after a successful prediction is returned from the AI/Model.
- Graceful failure: If logging fails, a small non-blocking error is shown to the user in Streamlit, rather than crashing the app.
