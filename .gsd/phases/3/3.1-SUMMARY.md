# Plan 3.1 Summary: Security Audit & SQLi Testing

## Objective
Final verification of the security measures implemented (parameterized queries and input validation) to ensure the system is proof against SQL injection.

## Changes
- Created `scripts/security_audit.py` which tests 23 different SQL injection payloads.
- Verified that all payloads are neutralized by either Pydantic validation (422) or parameterized queries (401).

## Files Touched
- `scripts/security_audit.py`

## Verification
- Ran `python scripts/security_audit.py`:
  - Total Tests Run: 46 (23 payloads x 2 fields)
  - Vulnerabilities Found: 0
  - Status: PASS

## Risks/Debt
- Manual browser UAT was blocked by environment issues (Playwright), but API-level security is empirically proven.
- Plaintext password storage remains the only major security debt in the "fake server" implementation.
