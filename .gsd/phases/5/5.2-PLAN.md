# Plan 5.2: Bento Box UI Implementation

## Objective
Design and implement a premium "Bento Box" style dashboard to display administrative insights.

## Context
- frontend/dashboard.html
- frontend/css/dashboard.css
- frontend/js/dashboard.js

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Create Dashboard Structure & Style</name>
  <files>frontend/dashboard.html, frontend/css/dashboard.css</files>
  <action>
    - Create `dashboard.html` with a grid layout containing various cards (bento boxes).
    - Style `css/dashboard.css` using modern aesthetics (glassmorphism, subtle gradients, rounded corners).
    - Cards should include: 
      - Total Users (Large card)
      - Recent Predictions (Wide card)
      - Prediction Breakdown (Medium card)
      - System Health (Small card)
  </action>
  <verify>Open `dashboard.html` in a browser and verify the visual layout matches the "Bento Box" style.</verify>
  <done>UI is visually premium and ready for data.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Populate Dashboard Data</name>
  <files>frontend/js/dashboard.js</files>
  <action>
    Create `frontend/js/dashboard.js`:
    - Fetch data from `/api/admin/stats`.
    - Populate the UI elements in `dashboard.html` with real numbers and lists from the backend.
    - Implement a "security check" that redirects non-admins away if they try to access the URL directly.
  </action>
  <verify>Log in as admin, navigate to dashboard, and see real data populated.</verify>
  <done>Dashboard is functional and data-driven.</done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard uses a bento box layout.
- [ ] Data is correctly fetched and displayed.
- [ ] Security redirect prevents unauthorized access.
