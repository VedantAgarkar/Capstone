# Summary — Plan 6.1: Theme Dashboard UI

## What Was Done
Completely replaced `dashboard.css` with a new navy/gold themed stylesheet.

### Changes Made
- **`frontend/css/dashboard.css`** — Full rewrite:
  - Background: deep navy radial gradient (`#11142b` → `#1a1f3a` → `#0d0f1f`)
  - Bento cards: dark glass (`rgba(20, 24, 50, 0.85)`) with gold (`#B79347`) border shimmer on hover
  - `stat-value` is now styled in gold with a warm glow
  - `breakdown-count` pills: gold background instead of blue
  - Table headers: coloured gold, rows get a subtle gold-tinted hover
  - `status-dot`: kept green (clear meaning), with pulse animation unchanged
  - All old `--accent-blue: #4facfe` and `--accent-purple: #00f2fe` removed
  - Bento grid layout untouched

## Verification
- No layout regressions; grid still fills 4 columns on wide screens, collapses on smaller
- Bento card hover lifts correctly with gold shadow
- `dashboard.js` integration unchanged
