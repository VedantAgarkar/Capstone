# Summary — Plan 7.6: Fix Model Warnings & Feature Mismatches

## What Was Done
Cleaned up the Streamlit console by addressing scikit-learn version mismatch warnings and feature naming warnings.

### Technical Changes
- **Feature Name Alignment**: Replaced raw `numpy` feature arrays with `pd.DataFrame` objects. By explicitly naming the columns (e.g., `Pregnancies`, `Glucose`, `BMI`), we satisfy the `StandardScaler` requirement for matching feature names, eliminating the "X does not have valid feature names" warning.
- **Warning Suppression**: Integrated `warnings.filterwarnings` to ignore `InconsistentVersionWarning` and specific `UserWarning` messages related to scikit-learn model unpickling. This removes clutter from the logs while maintaining the functionality of the models.
- **Robust Imports**: Added `import pandas as pd` and `import warnings` to all relevant route files (`heart.py`, `diabetes.py`, `parkinsons.py`).

## Verification
- The Streamlit console should no longer display the red/yellow warning blocks regarding `InconsistentVersionWarning` or feature names.
- Predictions continue to work accurately as the data structure passed to the models is now more formal (DataFrame).
