# Plan 8.1: Localize Heart Disease Assessment

## Objective
Implement full multi-language support (English/Marathi) in `heart.py` so it respects the user's language selection from the homepage.

## Context
- `backend/routes/heart.py`
- `backend/utils.py`: (For common translations)

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Implement Localization in Heart Disease App</name>
  <files>
    - backend/routes/heart.py
  </files>
  <action>
    - Define a `LABELS` dictionary in `heart.py` with sections for `"en"` and `"mr"`.
    - Translate all UI elements: Title, section headers, input labels, help text, selectbox options, slider labels, and assessment prompts.
    - Implement the `get_language()` call at the top of the file to determine `LANG`.
    - Create a helper `L(key)` to fetch localized text.
    - Replace all hardcoded strings in the Streamlit UI with calls to `L(key)`.
    - Special care: Ensure the AI system prompt is also translated to instruct the AI to respond in the correct language.
  </action>
  <verify>Check that `L()` helper is used throughout the file and `LABELS` has Marathi translations.</verify>
  <done>Heart disease app displays in Marathi when `?lang=mr` is passed in the URL.</done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All UI text in `heart.py` changes based on the `lang` query parameter.
- [ ] AI assessment is requested and delivered in the selected language.
- [ ] PDF generation uses the selected language for its results.
