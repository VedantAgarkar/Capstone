# Plan 1.1 Summary: Database Schema & Connection

## Objective
Set up a persistent SQLite database to store user credentials and establish a secure connection utility that uses parameterized queries by design.

## Changes
- Created `backend/database.py` with `get_db_connection()`, `init_db()`, and the `users` table schema.
- Updated `backend/main.py` to call `init_db()` on startup.

## Files Touched
- `backend/database.py`
- `backend/main.py`
- `backend/data/users.db` (created)

## Verification
- Ran `python backend/database.py` successfully.
- Verified `backend/main.py` imports and initializes correctly with `python -c "from backend.main import app; print('Import successful')"`.

## Risks/Debt
- Simple SQLite file storage; for production, a more robust DB might be needed, but this fulfills the "fake server" requirement.
- User passwords are currently stored as plain text (to be addressed in the next plan if needed, though not explicitly in SPEC, usually good practice to hash).
