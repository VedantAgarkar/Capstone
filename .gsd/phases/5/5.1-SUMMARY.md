# Plan 5.1 Summary: Conditional Dashboard Navigation

## Objective
Dynamically show the "Dashboard" link in the navbar only when an admin user is logged in.

## Changes
- Updated `checkAuthState` in `frontend/js/global.js` to detect `is_admin` role.
- Implemented DOM injection of the "Dashboard" link into the `.nav-menu` list.

## Files Touched
- `frontend/js/global.js`

## Verification
- Logged in with admin account: "Dashboard" appears.
- Logged in with regular account: "Dashboard" is hidden.
