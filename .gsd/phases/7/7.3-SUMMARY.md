# Summary — Plan 7.3: Dashboard Refresh & Final Polish

## What Was Done
Enhanced the Admin Dashboard with manual data refresh capabilities and improved data visibility.

### Changes Made
- **`frontend/dashboard.html`**: Added a "Refresh Data" button with a 🔄 icon to the dashboard header.
- **`frontend/css/dashboard.css`**:
  - Styled the refresh button with the gold/navy theme.
  - Added a `@keyframes spin` animation for the loading state.
  - Added responsive styles to stack the header content on mobile.
- **`frontend/js/dashboard.js`**:
  - Implemented `refreshDashboard(email)` to manually trigger `fetchStats`.
  - Added visual "loading" feedback by toggling the `spin` animation.
- **`backend/main.py`**:
  - Upgraded the recent activity query from `JOIN` to `LEFT JOIN` on the users table.
  - Added `IFNULL` fallback to display "Guest User" for predictions made without a registered account.

## Verification
- Refresh button accurately triggers data reload without full page refreshment.
- Spinner animation provides clear feedback during async operations.
- Admin dashboard now displays all predictions, including those from logged-out or unidentified users.
