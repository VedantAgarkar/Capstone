# Plan 5.1: Conditional Dashboard Navigation

## Objective
Dynamically show the "Dashboard" link in the navbar only when an admin user is logged in.

## Context
- frontend/js/global.js
- frontend/index.html (and other pages with navbars)

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Update Navbar for Admin</name>
  <files>frontend/js/global.js</files>
  <action>
    Modify `checkAuthState` in `frontend/js/global.js`:
    - check the `is_admin` flag in the stored user object.
    - If `is_admin` is true, inject a "Dashboard" link into the navbar (before the Profile/Login button).
  </action>
  <verify>Log in as admin and check if "Dashboard" appears. Log in as regular user and check if it remains hidden.</verify>
  <done>Navigation is personalized based on user role.</done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] "Dashboard" link is visible ONLY to admins.
- [ ] Clicking the link redirects to `dashboard.html`.
