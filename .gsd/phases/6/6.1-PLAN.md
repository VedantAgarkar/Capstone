# Plan 6.1: Theme Dashboard UI

## Objective
Update the `dashboard.html` and `dashboard.css` to precisely match the global navy blue (`#1a1f3a`), gold (`#B79347`), and white accent (`#ecf0f1`, `#ffffff`) theme defined in `global.css`. The current dashboard does not visually align with the main website.

## Context
- .gsd/SPEC.md
- .gsd/ROADMAP.md
- frontend/dashboard.html
- frontend/css/dashboard.css
- frontend/css/global.css

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Apply Global Theme Variables to Dashboard CSS</name>
  <files>
    - frontend/css/dashboard.css
  </files>
  <action>
    Review the color variables defined in `global.css` (e.g., `--primary-dark: #1a1f3a`, `--primary-accent: #B79347`, `--text-light: #ffffff`, etc.). Update the styles in `dashboard.css` to utilize these variables or to match them with exact hex codes. Replace any green, generic blue, or non-thematic colors with our navy/gold/white palette.
    - What to avoid and WHY: Avoid overriding fundamental layout properties of our Bento Box grid. The layout is good; we only need to change fonts, colors, borders, and shadows to match the theme.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Ensure there are no styling conflicts that break the Bento Box layout on a wide screen view.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Dashboard background, cards, text, and accents match the established navy blue/gold/white color scheme.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Align Dashboard HTML Layout With Theme</name>
  <files>
    - frontend/dashboard.html
  </files>
  <action>
    Update any inline styles or hardcoded HTML attributes within `dashboard.html` to align seamlessly with the new CSS. Ensure headers use the styled `primary-accent` and that icons or subtle elements have the appropriate `navy` or `gold` tint. Make sure all external CSS files (`global.css` and `dashboard.css`) are linked properly if they aren't already.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Check that the Dashboard still properly fetches logic from `dashboard.js`.
  </verify>
  <done>
    `dashboard.html` looks modern, premium, and inherently belongs to the rest of the web app theme.
  </done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] The dashboard features a navy blue background or consistent light variant with navy/gold elements as appropriate.
- [ ] No residual un-themed elements remain visible.
