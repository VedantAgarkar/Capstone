# Summary — Plan 7.5: Fix Marathi PDF Rendering

## What Was Done
Fixed the issue where Marathi PDF reports had broken word-wrapping (2-3 words per line) and bloated page counts (30+ pages).

### Technical Changes
- **Switched to `multi_cell`**: Replaced the fragmented `write()` + `ln()` logic with `pdf.multi_cell()`. This allows the `fpdf2` library to handle paragraph wrapping correctly based on the page margins.
- **Improved Font Support**: Added a search loop for multiple Devanagari fonts (`Mangal`, `Nirmala`, `Kokila`) to increase the chance of finding a compatible Unicode font on the host system.
- **Spacing Normalization**: Implemented a regex-based cleaner to collapse multiple consecutive newlines in the AI output, preventing unnecessary vertical gaps that caused the report to span dozens of pages.
- **Consistent Layout**: Simplified the fallback and Unicode paths to use the same `multi_cell` logic, ensuring a predictable layout regardless of the language or font availability.

## Verification
- Marathi reports will now wrap at the right margin like English ones.
- Page counts for typical assessments should drop from 30+ pages to 1-2 pages.
