# Plan 2.2 Summary: Login Form Integration

## Objective
Connect the login form in `login.html` to the backend `/api/login` endpoint and manage the user's logged-in state.

## Changes
- Updated `frontend/js/login.js` to send real login credentials to the backend.
- Implemented `localStorage` persistence for the logged-in user.
- Updated `frontend/js/global.js` to globally check for auth state and update the navbar (showing user name instead of "Login" button).
- Added logout functionality via the user profile button in the navbar.

## Files Touched
- `frontend/js/login.js`
- `frontend/js/global.js`

## Verification
- Login form sends POST request to `/api/login`.
- On success, `localStorage.user` is populated and user is redirected to `index.html`.
- On error (401), "Invalid email or password" is shown.
- Navbar correctly reflects auth state across the site.

## Risks/Debt
- `localStorage` is vulnerable to XSS; consider HTTP-only cookies if this were a production application.
