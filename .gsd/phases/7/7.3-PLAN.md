# Plan 7.3: Dashboard Refresh & Final Polish

## Objective
Enhance the Admin Dashboard UX by adding a manual refresh button and ensuring the data fetching logic is robust.

## Context
- frontend/dashboard.html
- frontend/css/dashboard.css
- frontend/js/dashboard.js

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add Refresh Button to Dashboard UI</name>
  <files>
    - frontend/dashboard.html
    - frontend/css/dashboard.css
  </files>
  <action>
    1. In `dashboard.html`: Add a button element (e.g., an icon or "🔄 Refresh") near the header or within the Recent Activity card.
    2. In `dashboard.css`: Style the button to match the gold theme. Ensure it has a subtle hover/spin animation.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Ensure the button is responsive and correctly placed in the Bento Box layout.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Dashboard has a visually appealing Refresh button.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Implement Refresh Logic and Fix Data Render</name>
  <files>
    - frontend/js/dashboard.js
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Create a `refreshDashboard()` function that re-calls the fetch logic for stats and activity.
    2. Hook up the new Refresh button to this function.
    3. Ensure that when data is "Loading", placeholders or spinners are shown as specified in the template.
    4. Verify that the "Prediction Breakdown" (Bento Box card) correctly clears old data before rendering new results to avoid duplication.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Manually check that clicking refresh updates the charts/tables without full page reload.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Dashboard data updates dynamically upon user request.
  </done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User can manually refresh dashboard data.
- [ ] UI remains consistent and premium (gold/navy theme) after updates.
- [ ] All recent user activities are visible as intended.
